I visited Nazaré Beach last year (2023). Really beautiful place. Shame on me for not taking my camera with me that day. I'm not a fan of smartphone cameras to be honest.
Here are some photos I took that day.

According to Wikipedia, Nazaré Beach is a neighborhood, on the seafront, of one of the most traditional Portuguese fishing villages, Nazaré, having the most popular bathing beach on the Portuguese west coast, where you can still find, on the sand, some women dressed in the traditional costume of seven skirts, taking care of the fish that dries in the sun, lined up on stakes.
