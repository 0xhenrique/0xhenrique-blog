# whois

Hello there! You can call me Henrique.
The main purpose of this website is to share some interesting things I find on the world wide web and the projects of mine.
Some of the stuff I work on [Github](https://github.com/henrique-marques-vsoft).

## My setup
Nothing fancy to be honest. Since I spend most of my time inside Emacs, I don't really _rice_ my computer.
I've been through that phase though. Remaping keybindings, customising themes, colourschemes etc.
Today things are simpler for me. Just my Emacs config and that's it.

Here are some of my configs:
- Laptop: Thinkpad T480
- OS: GNU Guix
- Shell: bash
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (1 monitor is enough for me)
- WM: EXWM
- Terminal: eshell/vterm/kitty
- CPU: Intel i5-8350U (8) @ 3.600GHz
- GPU: ðŸ˜•
- RAM: 24Gb
- Text editor: Emacs (29)

## Keyboards
### The Charybdis by Bastard Keyboards

Right now I'm using the Charybdis. It simply feels "correct" to type with it.  
The only _drawback_ from this keyboard is the price, but I don't think you will find a dactyl for a cheap price.  
As far as I know, there's no company mass producing that type of keyboard.  
But at the end I think it's worth it, at least for me it is.

### The Sofle V1 by Mechboards UK

The other one I have (although don't use very much anymore) is the Sofle V1 that I bought from Mechboards UK.
It was very nice to type on a _low profile_ keyboard. It's not so expansive as the Charybdis.
