Hello there! You can call me Henrique.
The main purpose of this website is to share some interesting things I find on the world wide web and the projects of mine.
Some of the stuff I work on [[https://github.com/0xhenrique][Github]].

** Keyboards
*** The Charybdis by Bastard Keyboards

Right now I'm using the Charybdis. It simply feels "correct" to type with it.  
The only _drawback_ from this keyboard is the price, but I don't think you will find a dactyl for a cheap price.  
As far as I know, there's no company mass producing that type of keyboard.  
But at the end I think it's worth it, at least for me it is.

*** The Sofle V1 by Mechboards UK

The other one I have (although don't use very much anymore) is the Sofle V1 that I bought from Mechboards UK.
It was very nice to type on a _low profile_ keyboard. It's not so expansive as the Charybdis.
