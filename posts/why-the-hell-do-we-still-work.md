Have you ever thought that if it weren't for technological advances, we'd still be lighting candles at night?
And what if I told you that the only reason society didn't collapsed yet is because technology keeps improving giving a fake perception of progress?
Why the fuck did your parents with no college were able to buy a house while you with all your diplomas can't even buy a cheap car?
Technology is clearly improving, so why the fuck things get harder and harder every year?
Why working isn't worth it anymore?
I plan to answer the questions above, but first I need to give you some context, some data about the wrecked world we live in today.
