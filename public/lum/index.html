<p>Lum is a project I started as a way to escape the feeling of being tied to the web-browser when it comes to bookmarks.
The objective is relatively simple, to have access to my bookmarks outside of the browser. This way I could call my bookmarks from anywhere on the computer, whether from Vim, Emacs, the browser itself, the window manager or wherever.
I&rsquo;m still not sure if I&rsquo;m going to turn this project into a CLI tool or a library. I still need to try to integrate Lum with some other tool and evaluate which points I failed, which ones I need to improve and where I got things right.
I also wanted to have contact with Rust in practice. I have some things to say about the Rust language, but I think that will be for another post on this blog.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m using JSON to save the bookmarks, but to be honest I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll keep this format until the end.
I&rsquo;m still evaluating whether this would be the most practical and quickest way, considering that I already accumulated more than 12 thousand bookmarks at the height of my NEET time.
I don&rsquo;t think parsing 12 thousand objects in JSON is efficient, but it&rsquo;s something I still need to test in practice.</p>
