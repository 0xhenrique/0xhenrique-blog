<p>I visited Nazaré Beach last year (2023). Such a lovely place.
Shame on me for not taking my camera with me that day. I&rsquo;m not a fan of smartphone cameras to be honest. Still, I couldn&rsquo;t let the opportunity pass. Here are some photos I took that day.</p>

<p>I plan to go back there in the winter, but this time I will remember to take my camera with me. I have an 18-55 and a 200mm, but I believe I will get better photos with the 200mm, especially in the higher parts. Not to mention that I will be able to aim further without losing too much sharpness.</p>
